"Other direct","Vehicle assembly","$12,700","$12,600","$11,900","For vehicle assembly, UBS costs are scaked up to account for the largest footprint  of average U.S. Vehicles: 6% for cars, 5% for crossovers, and 21% for SUVs. This also includes the incremental costs of vehicle improvements needed to meet efficiency standards. "
"Indirect cost","Includes depreciation, amortization, research and development (R&D), and administration expenses","$4,000","$10,584","$3,200","Based on UBS, combination vehicle indirect costs are fixed at 20.5% of direct costs. For electric vehicles, the same proportional R&D indirect cost reduction over time that UBS used for cars is assumed for all three vehicles classes."
